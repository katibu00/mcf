As we embark on a new chapter, these objectives encapsulate our commitment to positive change, sustainable impact, and community upliftment.</p>

<p><strong>MIG’s 7 Across 7, Road to 2025 version 1</strong></p>

<p>The Term MIG’s 7 Across 7: refers to the “MUJADDADI INCEPTION GOALS” which are 7 in numbers and it will be carried out and takes place across the 7 Local Governments the Senator is representing. The Goals were carefully coined and looked upon as follows:</p>

<h2>IQRA (Education):</h2>

<p>The word IQRA is the first word revealed to the prophet Muhammad (PBUH) as the first Ayah of the revelation, it emphasizes the importance of seeking knowledge. Education remains the focal point of development in every human endeavor.</p>

<p>Education empowers minds and transforms communities; moreover, it is the cornerstone of societal progress and individual development. It goes beyond the confines of classrooms; it is a force that shapes minds, fosters innovation, and lays the foundation for empowered communities. In the context of 'MIG's 7 Across 7 Road to 2025 Version 1,' our commitment to education is encapsulated in the Arabic word "IQRA," which means "read." This echoes the importance placed on knowledge and enlightenment right from the first revelation of the Holy Quran.</p>

<h3>Education: Bridging Gaps, Unlocking Potential</h3>

<p><strong>Introduction:</strong> In Bauchi and particularly in Bauchi South, the need for transformative educational initiatives is pressing. According to recent UNESCO and UNICEF statistics, Bauchi State bears the weight of a staggering 1,239,759 out-of-school children, the highest recorded number in Nigeria as of 2022. These alarming figures underscore the urgency to address the educational deficit in our community.</p>

<p><strong>Our Response:</strong> In response to this critical situation, MIG's 7 Across 7 is committed to proactive measures. Our focus on scholarships, payment of SSCE fees, securing JAMB scratch cards, extra-moral lessons, and the payment of WAEC fees is a strategic initiative. By prioritizing and encouraging girl child education through the distribution of sanitary pads, we aim to counter the challenges faced by the most vulnerable in our community.</p>

<p><strong>Impact:</strong> Through these programs, we envision not just reducing the statistics but, more importantly, transforming lives. We recognize the efforts of existing agencies and believe that our targeted approach will complement and enhance the ongoing endeavors to build a brighter and educated future for the children of Bauchi.</p>

<p><strong>Join Us in this Journey:</strong> We invite stakeholders and partners to join hands in our mission. Together, we can make significant strides in addressing the educational gaps, unlocking the untapped potential within our community, and ensuring no child is left behind.</p>

        <h5>Out of School Children:</h5>
        <p>As earlier mentioned above where Bauchi state records the highest number of out of school children with more than 1.2 million on the statistics recently releases by relevant bodies, much needs to be done in order to reduce the number where there’s education literacy there is no poverty, more important is social security and least of societal crimes.</p>
